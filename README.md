# The Tanzu Gym

This repository is my own space to keep track of my learnings around the [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) portfolio.

It includes documentation about my own experience, configurations, scripts and automation snippets in general, some of which are provided as examples and some others can be used right away.

The [web site](https://matteo-magni.github.io/tanzugym/) is mainly meant to be a reference for the future me,
in order not to forget what I've been learning along my Tanzu journey.
However, I'll be more than happy if it will help others, too.

If you feel like contributing or improving the repo with additional docs, fixes and suggestions, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/matteo-magni/tanzugym/issues).
