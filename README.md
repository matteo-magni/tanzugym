# The Tanzu Gym

This repository is my own space to keep track of my learnings around the [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) portfolio.

It's not meant to be a comprehensive source of information, but it's more a reference for the future me,
in order not to forget what I've learnt along my Tanzu journey.
I'll be more than happy if it will help others, too.

It includes documentation about my own experience, configurations, scripts and automation snippets in general, some of which are provided as examples and some others can be used out of the box without refactoring.

If you feel like contributing or improving the repo with additional docs, fixes and suggestions, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/matteo-magni/tanzugym/issues).
