# The Tanzu Gym

This web site is here for documenting my own experience and learnings around the [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu) portfolio.

It's not meant to be a comprehensive source of information, but it's more a reference for the future me,
in order not to forget what I've learnt along my Tanzu journey.
However, I'll be more than happy if it will help others, too.

If you feel like contributing or improving the repo with additional docs, fixes and suggestions, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/matteo-magni/tanzugym/issues).
